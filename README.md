# Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BetaSharp requires a legally purchased copy of Minecraft. We do not support or condone piracy. Please purchase Minecraft at [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net).

## Running

The launcher is the recommended way to play, it authenticates with your Microsoft account and starts the client automatically. \
Clone the repository and run the following commands.

```
cd BetaSharp.Launcher
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## Building

Clone the repository and make sure the .NET 10 SDK is installed. For installation, visit [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). \
The Website lists instructions for downloading the SDK on Windows, macOS and Linux.

It is recommended to build with `--configuration Release` for better performance. \
The server and client expect the JAR file to be in their running directory.

```
cd BetaSharp.(Launcher/Client/Server)
dotnet build
```
